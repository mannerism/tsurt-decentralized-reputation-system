# Tsurt: Decentralized Reputation System

Throughout our human history, we have evolved to collaborate with one another. 
And the entire evolution of human species can be summarized by the sheer scale of collaboration that has evolved over time. 

From hunter gatherer eras where humans participate in hunting as a team of 10-15 people, 
then a birth of religions indoctrinating rules and morals to direct humans to coordinate by the scale of thousands,
then a bitrh of internet, computer, open-source practically eliminating physical barriers which, in turn, allow collaboration at the scale of the entire humans in the planet.

In other words, the concept of collaboration is so deeply tied to the existence of our species. 
Without it, we won't be able to make progress. 
Without it, we won't be able to survive into the future.

Trust is the source of energy that propels collaboration.
Without trust, there is no collaboration. 
Even when there is collaboration with a very low trust, it will be too expensive to continue in a long run.

As a result, the most valuable asset in the world that one can have is trust.
It is more valuable than money and power. 
Having lots of money without trust will eventually vanish.
Having lots of power without trust will eventually corrupt.

In reality,scammers and thieves thrive in this world.
How? They game the system. 
They are exploiting our legal, political and social systems.
This phenomemon is so pervasive in our modern society that sometimes people wonder, 
"I should be smarter, more aggresive, and less honest towards others so I can exploit them."
I say big NO and FUCK YOU to this trend.
We as a human species are way better than this.
If we look around our neighbors, there are still many people who do good to others. 
They pick up trash on the street, say nice things to each other, help each other out in hard times, always be on time, and so forth.

If we can come up with a system that captures these minute interactions between humans for the good for good people and the bad for bad people. 
We can literally make the world a better place. Not a buzzword. For real guys. 

Sincerely,

P.S. join us if you think it's worth collaborating on this idea.
